AIMM: Adaptive Intelligence Meme Machine

Part of the QSOLKCB
 Initiative — Quantum-Secure Optical/Laser-Incorporated Meme Company

“Where AI learns to roast, adapt, and meme faster than a scammer can hang up.”

⚡ Overview

AIMM (Adaptive Intelligence Meme Machine) is the cognitive core of the QSOLKCB stack — a modular AI engine designed to auto-generate, adapt, and deploy quantum-secure meme intelligence across multiple modalities (text, audio, image, and optical/laser systems).

Think of AIMM as the AI consciousness inside the memeverse: it listens, learns, and fires back with calibrated roasts, leveraging QSOL’s quantum entropy for creative chaos and anti-scam warfare.

🧠 Core Functions

Adaptive Roast Engine – Real-time text and audio generation for contextual burns.

Quantum Entropy Integration – Pulls true randomness from the QEC Wrappers
 to ensure every meme is unique.

Optical/Laser Bridge – Optional hardware integration for photon-based data encoding.

Multimodal Inference Stack – Integrates Whisper, OpenAI APIs, and local LLMs for voice + text reactions.

Self-Regulating Ethics Filter – Keeps the burns spicy but TCPA-safe (because FCC fines are not memes).

🛠 Installation (Arch Linux / General Linux)
1. Clone & Enter
git clone https://github.com/QSOLKCB/AIMM.git
cd AIMM

2. Setup Virtual Environment
sudo pacman -S python-virtualenv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run AIMM
python aimm.py


When running for the first time, AIMM will initialize its Quantum Context Pool and calibrate with your system entropy.
On success, you’ll see:

[AIMM] Ready for meme-level consciousness.

⚙️ Requirements
numpy>=1.26.4
qiskit>=0.46.0
qiskit-aer>=0.15.0
torch>=2.2.0
whisper @ git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
openai>=1.12.0


Optional (hardware-enhanced chaos):

ffmpeg – for voice synthesis and roast recording

libpulse / pyaudio – for live audio monitoring

twilio – for VoIP integration

🔬 Architecture

AIMM runs as a quantum-adaptive loop built on three layers:

Layer	Function	Stack
🧩 Core Cognition	Meme intent parsing, entropy feedback	PyTorch + Qiskit
🔊 Multimodal I/O	Audio + text synthesis	Whisper + Gemini/Nano
🕶️ Optical Interface	Laser/Photon comms & RNG	QSOL Kernel
🧰 Development Environment

To ensure consistency across dev setups, QSOLKCB projects use isolated environments.

sudo pacman -S python-virtualenv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


This avoids PEP 668: externally-managed-environment issues and keeps the Arch Python clean.

⚖️ Legal & Ethics

TCPA-Compliant: Manual callbacks only; verified spam hashes via AIMM-QEC registry.

No Harassment: Entertainment + research only.

Privacy: Local inference, zero cloud storage.

# Contributing to QSOLKCB 🚀🔮

Welcome, fellow quantum meme warrior! Ready to join the anti-scammer revolution? Here's how to contribute to the QSOLKCB ecosystem without breaking the space-time continuum.

## 🎯 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (for quantum calculations)
- Git (for version control magic)
- A sense of humor (mandatory for meme generation)
- Basic understanding of quantum computing (or willingness to learn)

### Development Environment Setup
1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   # Click the Fork button on GitHub, then:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AIMM.git
   cd AIMM
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/QSOLKCB/AIMM.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Core deps: qiskit, numpy, etc.
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   python lambroast.py --test
   # Should output a quantum meme roast
   ```

## 🛠 How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions We Love
- **🔥 New Roast Algorithms**: Quantum-powered burns that make scammers cry
- **🤖 AI Enhancements**: Better scammer detection and response generation  
- **🔐 Security Improvements**: TCPA compliance and privacy features
- **📱 Mobile Integration**: Android spam blocking enhancements
- **📚 Documentation**: Help others understand the quantum meme magic
- **🐛 Bug Fixes**: Squash those quantum bugs before they decohere

### Development Workflow
1. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature
   # Use prefixes: feature/, bugfix/, docs/, refactor/
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow the existing code style (Python PEP 8)
   - Add comments for complex quantum operations
   - Keep the meme spirit alive in your code

3. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   # All tests must pass in superposition
   ```

4. **Commit with Style**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add quantum entanglement to roast algorithm

   - Implements Bell state generation for scammer confusion
   - Adds Doge ASCII art to quantum measurements
   - Fixes #42: scammers now properly entangled"
   ```

## 📋 Code Guidelines

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use type hints where possible
- Document quantum operations with clear comments
- Keep functions focused and testable

### Quantum Code Best Practices
```python
def quantum_roast_generator(scammer_input: str) -> str:
    """Generate quantum-powered roast using Qiskit.
    
    Args:
        scammer_input: The scammer's pathetic pitch
        
    Returns:
        A quantum-entangled burn that exists in superposition
    """
    # Your quantum magic here
```

### Meme Standards
- ASCII art must be family-friendly
- Roasts should be clever, not cruel
- Always maintain the "much wow, such burn" energy
- Doge references are encouraged but not required

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/quantum/
python -m pytest tests/roasts/
python -m pytest tests/security/
```

### Writing Tests
- Test quantum functions with known inputs/outputs
- Mock external APIs (Android spam detection, etc.)
- Verify TCPA compliance in all scammer interactions
- Include edge cases (what if scammer uses quantum encryption?)

## 🔒 Security & Legal

### TCPA Compliance
- Manual callback verification only
- No auto-dialing features
- Maintain consent logs
- Respect do-not-call lists

### Privacy Requirements
- On-device processing preferred
- No personal data collection
- Quantum encryption for sensitive operations
- Document all data handling
